<h2 id="header-two">Abstract</h2>
The world of OT and ICS devices is a complex system rooted in our daily lives. While most people are unaware of the existence of these devices, they are responsible for running most of our critical infrastructures, such as Water, Electric, Shipping, Transportation, and many others. These systems are built to automate and monitor processes in these facilities. But what happens when a malicious party takes over these systems. The security of these devices can be paramount to National Security. Widespread damage and outages can affect an entire nation, Attacks focused on these systems have begun to increase throughout the past years, and the trend indicates that this will continue. The security of these devices is sometimes lacking, but innovation focused on this space has led to better security in the long term. Implementing these security controls on critical infrastructure allows the analyst to identify and respond to these events before irreparable damage occurs. These controls also help support a common goal of securing these networks because we will give a blueprint of these attacks, enabling us to secure these networks further and help respond to potential attacks faster.
